#
Create a Python function that reads configuration data from a JSON file and uses it to process a list of numbers. Then, write pytest tests for this function.
Task:

Create a function called process_numbers that does the following:

Reads configuration from a JSON file named config.json
Takes a list of numbers as input
Processes the numbers based on the configuration
Returns the processed list


The config.json file should contain the following keys:

"operation": Can be either "add" or "multiply"
"value": A number to be used in the operation


The process_numbers function should apply the operation and value from the config to each number in the input list.
Write pytest tests to verify the function's behavior with different configurations and inputs.

Requirements:

Create three files:

number_processor.py: Contains the process_numbers function
config.json: Contains the configuration data
test_number_processor.py: Contains the pytest tests


Use pytest fixtures to manage the config file for different test scenarios.
Write at least three pytest tests:

Test with "add" operation
Test with "multiply" operation
Test with an empty input list


Use parametrized tests for testing multiple inputs.
Create a test that checks if the function raises an appropriate exception when the config file is missing or invalid.

Example config.json:
jsonCopy{
    "operation": "add",
    "value": 5
}
