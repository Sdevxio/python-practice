#<exercise>
Create a Python function that reads data from a config.ini file and a pytest to test this function.
Requirements:

Create a config.ini file with the following content:
Copy[Database]
host = localhost
port = 5432
username = admin
password = secret

Write a function called get_database_config() that reads the config.ini file and returns a dictionary with the database configuration.
Write a pytest function to test the get_database_config() function.
The test should check if all four keys (host, port, username, password) are present in the returned dictionary and if their values match the ones in the config file.
Use pytest fixtures to set up and tear down the config.ini file for testing.
