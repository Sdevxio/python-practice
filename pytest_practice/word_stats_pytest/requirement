Create a Python function called `word_stats` that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary with the following statistics:

'word_count': The number of words in the string
'char_count': The number of characters in the string (excluding spaces)
'avg_word_length': The average length of words in the string

Then, write pytest tests for this function.
Requirements:

Words are defined as sequences of characters separated by spaces.
Punctuation should be counted as part of a word.
The function should handle empty strings and strings with only spaces.
Round the average word length to two decimal places.

Create two files:

text_analyzer.py: Contains the word_stats function
test_text_analyzer.py: Contains the pytest tests
