Create a Python function called `analyze_numbers` that takes a list of numbers
as input and performs the following operations:

Calculate the sum of all numbers in the list
Find the maximum number in the list
Find the minimum number in the list
Calculate the average (mean) of all numbers in the list
The function should return a dictionary with these results.

Requirements:
The input list may contain both integers and floats
If the list is empty, return appropriate values (0 for sum, None for max and min,
and 0 for average)
Round the average to 2 decimal places
Use built-in functions like sum(), max(), min(), and len() where appropriate
Handle potential errors, such as division by zero when calculating the average of an empty list

Example usage:
print(analyze_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
Should output: {'sum': 15, 'max': 5, 'min': 1, 'average': 3.0}

print(analyze_numbers([10.5, 20.3, 3.25, -4.5]))
Should output: {'sum': 29.55, 'max': 20.3, 'min': -4.5, 'average': 7.39}

print(analyze_numbers([]))
Should output: {'sum': 0, 'max': None, 'min': None, 'average': 0}

print(analyze_numbers([100]))
Should output: {'sum': 100, 'max': 100, 'min': 100, 'average': 100.0}
