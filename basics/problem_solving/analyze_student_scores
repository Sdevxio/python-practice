Create a Python function called `analyze_student_scores`
that takes a list of student score dictionaries as input.
Each dictionary in the list represents a student and
contains their name and scores in different subjects.
The function should perform the following operations:

Calculate the average score for each student
Find the student with the highest average score
Calculate the average score for each subject across all students
Find the subject with the highest average score

The function should return a dictionary with these results.
Requirements:

Each student dictionary in the input list will have, the
format: {"name": "Student Name", "math": score, "science": score, "history": score}
Round all average scores to 2 decimal places
If the input list is empty, return an appropriate message
Use list comprehensions or dictionary comprehensions where appropriate
Handle potential errors, such as missing subjects for some students

Example usage:
students = [
{"name": "Alice", "math": 90, "science": 80, "history": 85},
{"name": "Bob", "math": 85, "science": 92, "history": 78},
{"name": "Charlie", "math": 78, "science": 85, "history": 90}
]
print(analyze_student_scores(students))
Should output something like:
{"student_averages": {"Alice": 85.0, "Bob": 85.0, "Charlie": 84.33},
"highest_average_student": "Alice",
"subject_averages": {"math": 84.33, "science": 85.67, "history": 84.33},
"highest_average_subject": "science"}
print(analyze_student_scores([]))
Should output: "No student data provided"
