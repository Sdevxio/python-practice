Write a Python function called `calculate_total` that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart. The function should take three parameters:

price: a float representing the price of one item
quantity: an integer representing the number of items
discount: a float representing the discount percentage (0-100)

The function should:

Calculate the total cost before discount (price * quantity)
Calculate the discount amount (total cost * (discount / 100))
Return the final total cost after applying the discount

Requirements:

Round the final result to 2 decimal places
Ensure that the discount is not applied if it's 0
Use basic arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /

Example usage:
print(calculate_total(10.00, 2, 10))  # Should output 18.00
print(calculate_total(25.50, 5, 0))   # Should output 127.50
print(calculate_total(5.99, 3, 15))   # Should output 15.27
print(calculate_total(50.00, 1, 20))  # Should output 40.00
